# Google-Book-Search

## Application description:

 React-based Google Books Search app that allows users to search, save, and delete books based off of googles api book search. I create React components, worked with helper/util functions, and utilized React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later

  The user can then click on the book and view it and see options to view the books description, price, add to cart, add to wishlist, ect:
