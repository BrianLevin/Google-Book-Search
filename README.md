# Google-Book-Search

## Application description:

 React based Google books search app that allows users to search, save, and delete books that they selected   based off of Googles API book search. I created React components, worked with util functions, and utilized React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
